# Task: support-cjs

Add support for a common JS build.

Once working, the clients will be able to import with `const expectMCP = require('expect-mcp/cjs')`

Update the ESBuild for this entry and make sure it saves as index.cjs

Update package.json for this import path

Set up a simple script to make sure it works
