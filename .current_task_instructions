# Task: setup-local-imports


Right now the test files in test/ all import the local 'expect-mcp' library like this:

import '../../src/vitest-setup.js';
import { MCPStdinSubprocess, mcpShell } from '../../src';

Change this so that they are imported accurately from the dist code. The test files should look like:

import 'expect-mcp/vitest-setup';
import { MCPStdinSubprocess, mcpShell } from 'expect-mcp';

This will use the 'dist' files instead of 'src' so we will need to run the build first.

I think we can make this work with a 'file:' reference inside devDependencies in package.json,
but I'm open to alternate approaches that accomplish the above goal.

Make sure the CI tests pass. See the defs inside ./.github and fix as needed.
